Repository that contains the files related to my final year project. The code files, Images used and the document with all the process

The project consists of an image recognition program. Users enter the path to the picture and the program generates a description of the picture with the objects found along with their location in the picture and size. In addition, there are three algorithms that try to figure out which object is in front of other object.

The first algorithm uses the percentage of the overlapping between the two objects. The second algorithm uses the central point position of the two objects. Finally, the third algorithm calculates which object is at the bottom of the other object and with this it determinens which is in front.

The project uses the Deep Java Library and executed with IntelliJ. This library can be download from: 
https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl

Originally, the code was executed in the path:
examples/src/java/ai/djl/examples

In order to run the project, the IvanDrive file must be executed

A video demonstration of the project can be found at:
